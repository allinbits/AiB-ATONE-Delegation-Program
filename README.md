# AiB ATONE Delegation Program

## The application for the AiB ATONE Delegation Program is now open!

The AiB ATONE Delegation Program is designed to recognise and reward both past and future contributions made by the AtomOne validators within the AtomOne ecosystem. The objective of the program is for AiB to contribute to a more decentralized, secure and community driven AtomOne ecosystem by incentivising validators who have made meaningful contributions and remain committed to the long-term success of the project. By ensuring a decentralized validator set, the program intends to help in further decentralizing the  distribution of economic and voting power.

Below you will find the program structure, application process and evaluation criteria to help you understand how you can take part in this initiative and help shape the future of AtomOne. 

### Program Overview

**The AiB ATONE Delegation Program** invites active validators to apply to receive an ATONE delegation from AiB as a recognition for their contribution to AtomOne. Delegations will be assigned for periods of six months, with a review and reassessment at the end of every six month period. These reviews will evaluate each validator's technical performance and the impact of their contributions. Validators who actively support AtomOne through innovative contributions, proactive participation and efforts on network reliability, will have the opportunity to receive ongoing delegations, while those who fail to meet the standard requirements of the program may see a reduction, or removal of their delegated tokens. Please find more details below on criteria for the assessment. 

The benefits of participating in the **AiB ATONE Delegation Program** are not limited to the delegated ATONE tokens. We believe that in addition to the latter, that inclusion in the program might provide increased visibility and recognition. Additionally the chosen validators will play a critical role in shaping AtomOne's development, security, and community engagement. 

### Application Process: How to get involved

Validators interested in the delegation program are required to [fill out an issue](https://github.com/allinbits/AiB-ATONE-Delegation-Program/issues/new/choose) on the AiB GitHub repository titled **'AiB ATONE Delegation Program'.** Each application is considered on its individual merits. This form will request information on validators previous and future commitments to the AtomOne project, including: 

1. **Name of Validator:** The full name of your validation node or team.

2. **Country:** The country where the validator is registered.

3. **Validator Email Address**

4. **Validator GitHub Account (or/and accounts of the validator representatives)**

5. **Validator Twitter Account**

6. **Past Contributions:** Share any past contributions to the AtomOne project, along with documented evidence of your work, including any relevant links.

7. **Future Contributions:** Outline a clear, actionable plan detailing your intended contributions to AtomOne over the next six months. Explain how you plan to accomplish those goals and how your efforts will strengthen the AtomOne project and benefits for the community. 

8. **List of chains that your validator operates on:** Provide a list or link that includes all the chains where your validator is currently performing validation operations.

9. **Disclosure of Conflict of Interest**: You are required to disclose all direct or indirect conflicts of interests, including affiliations with AiB, its employees or any other validator. 

10. **Know Your Customer (KYC) Verification**: Validators must be able to certify that they are not Restricted Persons as defined below by going through a KYC/KYB process on Synaps.   

Applications will be reviewed in order to assign upcoming ATONE delegations which are intended to remain active for six months. The delegations will be competitive, and there is no guarantee of being selected. Validators are encouraged to be as detailed as possible in their applications, providing clear proof of their contributions and vision for future involvement. The deadline for the first round of the application is Jan 15, 2025 at 12pm UTC.

### Performance Review to ensure accountability and continued contribution 

Every six months, the AiB team will evaluate each validator's contribution and its technical performance in the program according to validators' new applications. Based on this review, delegations may be increased, maintained, decreased or removed entirely. Performance evaluations will consider multiple factors, with emphasis on both the delivery of the past contributions and adherence to the commitments outlined in the validator's plan for future contributions. Successful completion of promised work strengthens the chance for continued or increased delegation.

Some key criteria for assessing performance include: 

- **Contributions to building the AtomOne community:** Validators are encouraged to actively drive awareness of the chain, onboarding new community members and leveraging their channels to provide updates and progress on the AtomOne chain to the larger community, as well as sharing educational content and recommending reputable contributors to the network. 

* **Network Reliability:** Consistent uptime, timely software updates, and responsiveness to network events are essential for building a resilient ecosystem. In addition validators are expected to upgrade within 24 hours of new protocol releases. Validators with poor network performance may see reductions in delegations.

- **Support for AtomOne validators:** In case of any downtime, updates or emergency upgrades, validators are expected to ensure support to fellow validators at short notice. 

* **Transparency towards the community including their delegators:** Validators are expected to ensure that all their delegators receive updated communication regarding the activities of their validator.

- **Active participant in Governance:** A major goal for AtomOne is to create an improved governance system. Therefore active participation in discussions related to governance proposals and voting are fundamental to fulfill its vision. Therefore Validators are expected to vote on all governance proposals. The validators absent from governance activities may see reduction in delegations.

* **Tooling Development/ Infrastructure support:** Validators who are actively looking to expand the ecosystem by introducing dashboards, explorers, wallets, other tools or providing infrastructure support in order to ensure robust running of the chain and support of its growth are taken into high consideration.

- **No Malicious Activity**: Validators must maintain network integrity and avoid any slashing event. Any involvement in malicious activity or double-signing events will result in immediate removal from the delegation program and the redelegation of the existing delegated tokens. 

By holding validators accountable, AiB aims to ensure an environment of trust and dedication in the AtomOne community.

 

**_Please note that AiB reserves the right to revoke or modify its ATONE delegations from any participating validator at any time and for any reason, Participation in this program does not guarantee any delegations._**

**_All delegations are made at AiB's sole discretion. Delegation amounts will be determined through an internal evaluation process that considers the key criteria outlined above. AiB is under no obligation to disclose the criteria or rationale for these decisions, or justification for the delegation amounts awarded._**

**Let's collaborate to shape the future of AtomOne**

AiB believes that a thriving decentralized ecosystem can only be achieved through collaboration and mutual support. Therefore, AiB's goal with the ATONE Delegation program is to help with rewarding the contributors who are providing support to the AtomOne project. 

We invite all eligible validators to apply, demonstrate their impact and contribute to the growth of the  AtomOne project for the benefit of the entire AtomOne community.
